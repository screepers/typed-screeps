[![Github action](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps/actions/workflows/CI.yml) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@types/screeps)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/screeps)

## Installation

The type definitions are published on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). To install them, run the following.

```bash
# npm
npm install @types/screeps

# yarn
yarn add @types/screeps
```

## Differences from **[Screeps-Typescript-Declarations](https://github.com/screepers/Screeps-Typescript-Declarations)**

This repo has more activity and is considerably more up-to-date.

### Breaking Changes:

- `Memory` is typed by default. The added typings are:

  - `CreepMemory`
  - `FlagMemory`
  - `SpawnMemory`
  - `RoomMemory`

  If you like the idea of typed memory, but aren't ready to just jump fully in, you only need to make sure you define an interface for the above four types. Then you can extend them at a later time.

  Example:

  ```TypeScript
  interface CreepMemory { [name: string]: any };
  interface FlagMemory { [name: string]: any };
  interface SpawnMemory { [name: string]: any };
  interface RoomMemory { [name: string]: any };
  ```

  If you don't want to add types to the global `Memory` object, you will need to add the following interface along with the four above.

  Example:

  ```Typescript
  interface Memory { [key: string]: any };
  ```

- Any place in code that uses a constant (ex `STRUCTURE_EXTENSION` or `FIND_MY_SPAWNS` is now constrained to use literal types. Here is the list of the new types:

  ```
  BodyPartConstant
  BuildableStructureConstant (this is a subset of StructureConstant)
  StructureConstant
  FindConstant
  LookConstant
  DirectionConstant
  ResourceConstant
  MineralConstant (this is a subset of ResourceConstant)
  ColorConstant
  ScreepsReturnCode
  Terrain
  ```

  To update your code, you just need to change any `string` types to match one of the above. For example, if your code had:

  ```TypeScript
  function getBody(): string[] {
    return [ WORK, MOVE, CARRY ];
  }

  ```

  Change it to:

  ```TypeScript
  function getBody(): BodyPartConstant[] {  // this line changed
    return [ WORK, MOVE, CARRY ];
  }
  ```

- Some original functions were incorrectly typed to not include `null` as a possible return. You may need to update your code to reflect this update (ex. `findClosestByPath` or `findClosestByRange`)
- `Game.getObjectById()` now returns typed objects according to the type of the Id (ex. `Id<StructureTower>` returns `StructureTower` type).

  Use of `string` typed Id, is deprecated and may be removed in the future. When using string Ids, the type of the returned game object is `unknown` which requires manual type assertion. Previously this function returned `any` typed objects which could accidently be left untyped;

  If you have code like this (un-type-asserted use of `Game.getObjectById`)

  ```TypeScript
  interface Memory{
    towerIds: string[];
  }

  Memory.towerIds.forEach((towerId) => {
    const tower = Game.getObjectById(towerId); // type of returned tower is 'unknown' instead of 'any'
    tower.attack(targetCreep); // Error Object is of type unknown ts(2571)
  })
  ```

  Change it store typed Ids:

  ```TypeScript
  interface Memory{
    towerIds: Array<Id<StructureTower>>;
  }

  Memory.towerIds.forEach((towerId) => {
    const tower = Game.getObjectById(towerId); // type of returned tower is StructureTower
    tower.attack(targetCreep);
  })
  ```

  If you're already manually asserting the type of the game object, you're not required to change anything immediately however this is deprecated and may be removed in the future.

  ```TypeScript
  const towerId: Id<StructureTower> = ""  as Id<StructureTower>;
  const tower1 = Game.getObjectById(towerId); // recommended use, returns StructureTower type
  const tower2 = Game.getObjectById<StructureTower>(""); // @deprecated returns StructureTower type
  const tower3 = Game.getObjectById("") as StructureTower; // @deprecated returns StructureTower type
  ```

  `Id<T>` types are assignable to `string` but the reverse is not allowed implicitly. To assign a `string` type to an `Id<T>` type, you must explicitly assert the type.

  ```TypeScript
  const typedId: Id<Creep> = "123" as Id<Creep>; // assertion required
  const untypedId1: string = typedId; // no assertion required
  ```

- Game objects have typed id properties `id: Id<this>`. These typed ids can by passed to `Game.getObjectById()` to receive typed game objects matching the type of the Id. See above bullet for more details.

  ```TypeScript
  creep.id // has type Id<Creep>
  copy = Game.getObjectById(creep.id) // returns type Creep
  tower.id // has type Id<StructureTower>
  ```

### Additional (non-breaking) Features:

- `ConstructionSite` can be optionally constrained by a structure type (ex. `ConstructionSite<STRUCTURE_CONTAINER>`). TypeScript will enforce that the `type` property of the `ConstructionSite` appropriately matches
- `Resource` can optionally be constrained (ex. `Resource<RESOURCE_ENERGY>`)
- `Mineral` can optionally be constrained by `MineralConstant` (ex. `Mineral<RESOURCE_GHODIUM>`)
- `Structure` can optionally be constrained (ex `Structure<STRUCTURE_SPAWN | STRUCTURE_EXTENSION>`)
- Screeps classes derived from `Structure` (ex `StructureContainer`) have their `type` property correspondingly constrained
- `LookAt` results are now constrained to the type looked for
- Results from `Find`-type functions are now constrained to have a `RoomPosition`
- Typings for new RawMemory and RoomVisuals
- New union type `AnyCreep` to represent `Creep` and `PowerCreep`
